# nano-drum
8 bit ARDUINO NANO drum machine inspired by Jan Ostman but adding playability to existing sequencer

- Record mode
- Possible dual 8-bit output
- SD card for more samples
- Sample timestretching?

Some interesting ideas for dual-8-bit PWM: <https://www.deeptronic.com/electronic-circuit-design/high-precision-16-bit-audio-output-using-cascaded-8-bit-pwm-with-auto-calibration/>
